To get the 'sensor.py' to run once every 5 minutes, I run 'crontab -e' and put the following line into it:

*/5 * * * * sudo /home/porter/coup/sensorLog.py  >> /home/porter/sensorLog.txt 2>&1

(You'll need to modify it, unless your username is 'porter'

This will output both stdout and stderr into the file sensorLog.txt.

If you don't want error messages in your log file, remove the '2>&1' at the end of the line.

If you do this, error messages will be sent to you by email.  To read them, you'll need install mail a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) and email client:
    sudo apt-get install postfix
    sudo apt-get install mutt
